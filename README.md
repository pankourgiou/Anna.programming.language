#This is a retro futuristic Anna programming language interpreter based on html...simple commands maybe later there will be some upgrade we will see-->you will have to copy-paste the code save it as an .html file then double click and you are ready to write you first program in Anna programming language.
#There is also an auto changing theme. I wrote this programming language with much care and I hope you enjoy it even if it is a bit simple.
